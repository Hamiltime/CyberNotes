#####SETUP#####
#PowerDecode takes a .ps1 or powershell within a .txt file and de-ofuscates it

#Enable scripts execution: launch PowerShell as Administrator and run the command:
Set-ExecutionPolicy bypass
#If it doesn't work, open Registry Editor as Administrator and go to:
Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\PowerShell
Set the parameter "ExecutionPolicy" on value "Bypass"

#Disable any antivirus software in order to allow the tool to analyze malware without interruption.

Click on PowerDecode.bat to start the GUI
