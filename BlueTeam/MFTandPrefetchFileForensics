#####EZTools MFTECmd#####
-Tool that looks at MFT and finds past file and directory activity

#Download Get-ZimmermanTools: https://ericzimmerman.github.io/#!index.md (May require .net runtime: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/9.0 )
Open a PowerShell window as administrator
Allow script execution by running command “Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted”
cd .\Get-ZimmermanTools\
.\Get-ZimmermanTools.ps1

#Copy EZTools folder to suspect machine
Open command prompt as administrator
run MFTECmd.exe -f C:\$MFT --csv c:\temp (or anywhere else)
Launch TimelineExplorer.exe
file - Open - select CSV
Sort on Created0x10(first execution) or Last Modified0x10(most recent execution) column (UTC time, +5 hours to central)
Look at "File Name" column: filter ".exe", look at .pf(prefetch) files directly after the malicious exe (cmd.exe? wmic? ipconfig? systeminfo?)
	-Lots of noise, use filters

Tips:
	Hide x30 date columns
	Tag items of interest while reviewing, so you can filter by them later
	Drag column to top for grouping
	Search options allows search to be a filter or "find"



#####EZTools PECmd.exe#####
-Local Files Prefetch -Windows stores prefetch files at: C:\windows\prefetch
-More evidence of exe execution locally
Prefetch files contain the following data (In recent Windows 10):
The last 8 times the binary was run
The number of times the binary was run
The binary name
The file size

run PECmd.exe -d C:\windows\prefetch --csv c:\temp (or anywhere else)
Launch TimelineExplorer.exe
file - Open - select CSV
"Files Loaded" column shows .dll files
Note: can do single prefetch files with: run PECmd.exe -f C:\windows\prefetch --csv c:\temp
