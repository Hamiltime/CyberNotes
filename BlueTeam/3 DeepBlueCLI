DeepBlueCLI 
https://github.com/sans-blue-team/DeepBlueCLI


-Tool that shows malicious and suspicious logs, also works well on a domain controller
-Keep in mind, logs might not exist if the actor purged the event log
	-They do this by running "wevtutil cl <logname>" or "Remove-EventLog -LogName <logname>"
		-This does leave an Event 104 "The <logname> log file was cleared" event in System log
